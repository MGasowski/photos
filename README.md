# Photo Gallery App

This is a create-react-app based application.
You can browse photos fetched from API - three at a time. You can use pagination buttons below the pictures.
You can preview any photo by clicking on it.

For styling I mainly used TailwindCSS. Application offers automatic dark mode by clicking te right corner button.
